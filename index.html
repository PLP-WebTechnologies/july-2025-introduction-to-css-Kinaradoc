        <p>Pain itself is something that one avoids, but sometimes circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure some great pleasure.
            ,but the vehicle of the urn runs a short course, filled with noble dignity.</p>
        <p>"He shall thrive with a smile, but yearns for a lionâ€™s ambition in his learning.
            Let the rhythm be cared for, love shaped by structured thought.</p>
        <p>Proper balance, life in elevated elements.</p>
